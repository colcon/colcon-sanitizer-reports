    package:
        Name of the ros2 package where the error occurred.

    error_name:
        Name of the sanitizer error (such as "data race", "lock-order-inversion", etc). See
        SanitizerSection for more details.

    stack_trace_key:
        The key of a significant stack trace. Note that a single sanitizer error/warning section may
        have multiple significant stack traces, resulting in multiple keys and thus, multiple
        SanitizerLogParserOutputPrimaryKeys. See SanitizerSectionPart and
        SanitizerSectionPartStackTrace for more details.

class SanitizerLogParser:
    """Parses sanitizer error and warning sections from a log and generates a summary report.

    The parser works with the output of "colcon test" and reports information about all sanitizer
    (eg. AddressSanitizer or ThreadSanitizer) error and warning output. Every sanitizer error and
    warning occurs during tests for some ros2 package, has a specific error name, and has one or
    more significant stack traces that are helpful for determining the root cause of the error or
    warning.

    Lines from "colcon test" output should be added to the parser one at a time with the
    parse_line() method. When finished, the report can be access from the csv property.

    CSV output columns are "package,error_name,stack_trace_key,count". Package, error_name, and
    stack_trace_key columns make up the primary key for CSV output. See
    SanitizerLogParserOutputPrimaryKey for more details about the primary key.

    CSV output additional columns include:

    count:
        The count of times the fields from the primary key occur while parsing the log.

    sample_stack_trace:
        The full output of one of the stack traces that matched the primary key.

    XML output is a xUnit-style Jenkins compatible string. Packages present in
    SanitizerLogParserOutputPrimaryKey are `testcases` in the xml string, and each sanitizer
    warning and error is an `error`. Stack trace key and error count are attributes of the error.

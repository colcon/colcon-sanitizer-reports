class SanitizerSectionPart:
    """Parses relevant stack traces from log lines of a single sanitizer section part.

    A sanitizer section part is a group of contiguous lines in a sanitizer section starting with a
    single non-indented line followed by all the indented lines until the next non-indented line.

    Examples from sanitizer output include:
        WARNING: ThreadSanitizer: lock-order-inversion (potential deadlock) (pid=26542)

        SUMMARY: ThreadSanitizer: lock-order-inversion (potential deadlock) <snip>
    or
        ==5504==ERROR: LeakSanitizer: detected memory leaks

        Direct leak of 1 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:
            <snip relevant stack trace>

        Indirect leak of 1 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:
            <snip irrelevant stack trace>

        SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: 554924 byte(s) leaked in 6385 allocation(s).

    The first example has two section parts. Part one starts with the lock-order-inversion line and
    includes all the indented lines until the summary line. It includes two relevant and one
    irrelevant stack traces to report. Part two is the summary line.

    The second example has four section parts. Part one is just the summary line. Parts two starts
    with the non-indented "Direct leak" line and includes the following stack trace that is relevant
    to report. Part three starts with the non-indented "Indirect leak" line and includes the
    following stack trace that is irrelevant to report. The final part is the summary line.

    See _FIND_RELEVANT_STACK_TRACE_BEGIN_REGEXES_BY_ERROR_NAME for stack trace header search
    patterns that determine which stack traces are relevant. Different error/warning names have
    different relevant stack traces.

    After initialization, SanitizerSectionPart includes the following data member.
